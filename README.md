# Convenience Store Project

A convenience store that is meant to a project to get accustomed with python.

Mirrors what goes on in a real life convenience store from inventory, money counting,
employee and hierarchy between employees, logins, and action event logs.

It is accompanied with its database that was used (Excel) since it was a smaller scale project.
Worked with autopygui, openpyxl, and a couple more libraries that made this project possible.

It was worked on by my team where my programming partner and I were leading.
